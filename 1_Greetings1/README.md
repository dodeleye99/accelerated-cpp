# Chapter 1: Greetings â€“ Part 1

Contains C++ source code files for programs which each asks for the user's name and returns an approriate greeting (using their name).

### Code:
1) **greetings1.cpp** gives a basic greeting.
2) **greetings2.cpp** outputs a greeting surrounded by a border.

### New Concepts:
* Input stream and operator, for reading user input
* The string type
* String concatenation (joining a string literal with a string object)
* Constants
* Object constructors
