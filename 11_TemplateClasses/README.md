# Chapter 11: Template Classes
In [Chapter 8](../8_GenericFunctions), **function templates** were introduced, allowing one to define a "family of functions", while [Chapter 9](../9_Classes) introduced **classes**, allowing one to define their own type.

This chapter combines both of these concepts together, focusing on what are known as **class templates**.
