# Chapter 11: Template Classes
In [Chapter 8](../8_GenericFunctions), **function templates** were introduced, allowing one to define a "family of functions", while [Chapter 9](../9_Classes) introduced **classes**, allowing one to define their own type.

This chapter combines both of these concepts together, focusing on what are known as **class templates**, which implement **generic classes**. 

They allow one to create a single definition of a class with a selection of data and function members that together utilise one or more type parameters to define them. This effectively results in a system of classes restricted only by the operations the class members require of the type parameters.
