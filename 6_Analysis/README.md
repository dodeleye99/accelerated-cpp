# Chapter 6: Algorithms

An further extension of the student grading system from previous chapters. It explores various algorithms from the C++ standard library and applies them to the grading system to perform analyses on the final grades students achieved, separating the students that did all the homework from those who didn't.

By assumption, any zeros inputted for the homework grades are treated as homework not done. Also, it is assumed that each student should have done at least one homework assignment, and therefore inputting no homework grades for a student is still treaded as homework not done.
