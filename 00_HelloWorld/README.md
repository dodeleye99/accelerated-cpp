# Intro: Hello World!

Contains multiple C++ source code files for the "Hello World" program. They differ in the following ways:

### Directories of Code:
1) [`hello_world1`](hello_world1) also outputs a few of the escape sequences. 
2) [`hello_world2`](hello_world2) demonstrates how the code can be written on multiple lines
3) [`hello_world3`](hello_world3) outputs source code for a simple "Hello World" project.

### New Concepts:
* The main function
* Output stream and operator
* String literals
* Escape sequences
* Manipulators
* Namespaces and scopes
* Directives (`#include`) to call standard library facilities.
