# Chapter 8: Generic Functions

This chapter explores special kinds of functions, known as generic functions. 
These are functions with one or more arguments with types only restricted by the operations performed on them in the function.

C++ implements generic functions through defining what are known as templete functions, which involve writting a single definition for a family of functions (o
