# Chapter 3: Grades

The source code is for programs which implement a student grading system. 
After greeting the user in the same way as Chapters 1 and 2, it asks for the user's exam grades (midterm and final), and then for their homework grades.
These grades are then used to calculate a final grade for the user.

The final grade for the student is calculated as the sum of 20% of the midterm exam grade, 40% of the final exam grade, and 40% of the _average_ homework grade. 

# Code:
1) **grades1.cpp** does the above.

### New Concepts:
* reading multiple inputs from the user.
* floating-point 'double' numbers, for representing non-integer or decimal numbers.
* prescision manipulator for decimals.
