# Chapter 3: Grades

The source code is for programs which implement a student grading system. 
After greeting the user in the same way as Chapters 1 and 2, it asks for the user's exam grades (midterm and final), and then for their homework grades.
These grades are then used to calculate a final grade for the user.
