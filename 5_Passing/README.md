# Chapter 5: Passing

An extension of the student records system established in Chapter 4. It now distinguishes between students that passed and stutents that failed, based on their final grade being above or below a fixed threshold. The program uses 60 as the threshold.

### Directories of Code:
1) **passing1** outputs all the students with their final grades as usual, but adds "(fail)" next to every grade below the threshold, while making no comment on the passing grades.
2) **passing2** instead extracts the students that failed from the students that passed, and outputs a separate list for each of these two groups. Students that did not do homework are also put into the failed category.
### Extension:

### New Concepts:
* Using iterators to traverse over the elements of a data container while pointing to them.
* The * operator, used to get the value that an iterator is pointing to.
* Deleting an element of a container
* The list data structure, implementing a linked list.
* Determining which data container (particularly, vector or list) would be most efficient to use, by acknowleing their pros and cons.
