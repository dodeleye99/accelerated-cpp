# Chapter 1: Greetings â€“ Part 1

Contains C++ source code files for programs which each asks for the user's name and returns an approriate greeting (using their name).

### Directories of Code:
1) [`greetings1`](greetings1) gives a basic greeting.
2) [`greetings2`](greetings2) outputs a greeting surrounded by a border.

### New Concepts:
* Input stream and operator, for reading user input
* Variables and assignment
* The `string` type
* String concatenation (joining a string literal with a string object)
* Constants
* Object constructors
* Object members (methods or functions) and the member access operator
