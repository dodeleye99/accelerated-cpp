# Chapter 2: Greetings â€“ Part 2

Contintues on from part 1.

### Code:
1) **greetings1.cpp** outputs a greeting not only surrounded by a border, but with _padding_ to give blank space around the greeting.
2) **greetings2.cpp** uses less padding, and also breaks the code down by introducing a function that handles the greeting.

### Extensions:
3) **triangle.cpp** does further experimentation with borders by simply outputting a triangle border.

### New Concepts:
* The int data type, used to represent integers
* Basic arithmetic operators
* Logical operators
* Iteration through while loops, running a block of code repreatedly against a fixed condition
* Branching through if-else statements, using conditions to determine out of a set of code blocks which to run (or if a single block should be run)
* Incrementation operator
* Size types used as a mnemonic to approprately represent the size of string and container objects.
* Definiing functions
