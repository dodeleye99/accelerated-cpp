# Chapter 2: Greetings â€“ Part 2

Contintues on from part 1.

1) **greetings1.cpp** outputs a greeting not only surrounded by a border, but with _padding_ to give blank space around the greeting.
2) **greetings2.cpp** uses less padding, and also breaks the code down by introducing a function that handles the greeting.
