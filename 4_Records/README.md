# Chapter 4: Records

An extension of Chapter 3. Rather than only the grade of one student calculated, the program allows multiple student records to be inputted by the user, and calculates the final grade for each one. 

It then neatly outputs in alphebetical order each student's name along with their final grade.

### Code:
1) records1.cpp does as explained above.

### Extension:

### New Concepts:
* defining _struct_ types, used to group data values to form a data structure, so that it can be treated as a single entity.
* using the max algorithm to find the maximum value of a data set.
* sorting struct types by specifying the comparison function used to define the ordering.
