# Intro: Hello World!

Contains multiple C++ source code files for the "Hello World" program. They differ in the following ways:

1) **hello_world1.cpp** also outputs a few of the escape sequences. 
2) **hello_world2.cpp** demonstrates how the code can be written on multiple lines
3) **hello_world_sample.cpp** outputs source code for a simple "Hello World" project.
