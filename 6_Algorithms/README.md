# Chapter 6: Algorithms

An further extension of the student grading system from previous chapters. It explores various algorithms from the C++ standard library and applies them to the grading system to perform analyses on the final grades students achieved, separating the students that did homework from those who didn't.

By assumption, any zeros inputted for the homework grades are treated as homework not done.
